# Oxidation Resistant MPEAs
## Supplementary Information Files
#### SI_doc.docx - discussion of UMAP plot construction and pre-oxidation candidate alloy microstructures
#### SI_doc_figures.pptx - figures that correspond to SI_doc.docx
#### all_data_noCB.csv –literature dataset file formatted and used for training and testing; carbon and boron compositions were removed. This dataset has 4 repeat entries that were not discovered until after all experiments were done. This original data file is kept to account for how the current model used was created.
#### final_TPOT_model.py – model output from TPOT run after 50 generations
#### SI TPOT Regression Model.ipynb – jupyter notebook used to create final_TPOT_model.py and to plot parity plot
#### interactive_visualization.html – UMAP interactive visualization of literature dataset, all simulated compositions, and final chosen compositions. Legend items can be toggled on or off to view subsets of scatter points
#### interactive_visualization.ipynb – jupyter notebook used to create UMAP plot
#### Table_S1.csv – literature dataset with a reference to each entry
#### Table_S2.csv – data simulated with Thermo-Calc and ML model for all new compositions
